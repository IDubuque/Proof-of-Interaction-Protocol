# Proof of Interaction Protocol (POIP)

## Life is full of events!
Proof of Interaction Protocol is designed to offer digital records (POI) of these real-world events!

Users can build a social profile of events, receive perks, and more from owning these digital records. 

## The Protocol

POIP leverages smart-tags to authenticate a user physically interacted with a secure smart-tag and awards an event token (POI) to the user as a digital record on the blockchain.
